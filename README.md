Loose Leaf
===========

Simple notes and sketches.


### Branches

*push-strokes-to-texture-helper*
This branch is a utility branch that will force all strokes on every page/scrap onto the texture for that page/scrap. there is 1 additional button in the sidebar, and tapping it will auto-start writing all strokes to its respective texture. after the process is complete, the content of the app can be exported from Organizer, and every page/scrap will only have 1.strokedata inside it (the empty stroke). this will help reduce the number of files in a Loose Leaf archive, which is particularly helpful when created first time user data.

*master*
stable development branch

*edge*
unstable development branch. this branch is the for active development.

*alpha*
stable production branch

*jen*
mostly stable branch for Jen C. this build will save all strokes to files, and will never delete any stroke data. This way, an entire page can be recreated from the stroke data if the pen rendering algorithm ever changes.
